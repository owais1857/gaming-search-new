This year’s version walks a little taller, looks a little more toned, and has better footwork than last year’s model. You can tell its put in the work in the off-season, but there’s still more to be done. Proper teaching tools aren’t here yet, and Road to Glory and Dynasty still need meaningful changes. But Dynasty is at least compelling enough, and the on-field game still has it where it counts. You can tell the College Football team is listening, and that it cares. EA has avoided the sophomore slump, but like any college football fan will tell you, you don’t build a Dynasty off a couple good seasons alone. You have to plan for the future. College Football 26 is a step in that direction, but EA will have to keep at it if they want this series to be up there with the all-time greats.

    "summary": "Soulframe developer Digital Extremes says the \"backlog of dev kits\" is the reason players have yet to see an official Nintendo Switch 2 port for Warframe.",
    "content": "Digital Extremes says the \"backlog\" of dev kits is the reason players have yet to see an official Nintendo Switch 2 port for Warframe.Studio CEO Steve Sinclair explained why the team behind the popular space ninja action game hasn’t created a port for Nintendo’s sequel hybrid console during a press Q&A IGN attended ahead of today’s TennoCon 2025 livestream. He said the Digital Extremes tech team is “so excited” to see what a Nintendo Switch 2 Warframe port would look like but can’t even begin development until they get their hands on the necessary hardware.“Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” Sinclair said. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone… just one, that’s all it would take.”Digital Extremes brought its 12-year-old multiplayer hit to Switch in 2018, allowing longtime players to enjoy all that Warframe has to offer, at home and on the go. It is available to play through Nintendo's new console but only through backward compatibility, with Nintendo including it on a list of Switch 2 titles that still suffer from start-up issues.When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe. Absolutely.“Digital Extremes said it’s still investigating the cause of these hangups, but it’s the enhancements that a Switch 2 version of Warframe could bring that have players truly excited. Sinclair teased faster load times as just one of the potential upgrades.“I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe. Absolutely.”The Switch 2 launched on June 5, 2025, introducing new features such as Joy-Con mouse functionality, improved graphics, and enhanced social tools. Although its launch lineup was able to lean on third-party support with titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Deltarune Chapter 1 – 4, Split Fiction, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, and Yakuza 0 Director’",

It was yet another jam-packed showing for the Digital Extremes team as it careens toward the launch of more story expansions for Warframe and the eventual launch of Soulframe.Digital Extremes celebrates TennoCon 2025 with gameplay demos for Soulframe and Warframe.

Plus, whether you’re seeing everything for the first time or just looking for a refresher, we’ve also included information Digital Extremes shared with press during a TennoCon preview event IGN attended earlier this month.SoulframeSoulframe is still very much in development, but that didn’t stop Digital Extremes from providing attendees with a new gameplay deep dive. Just like TennoCon 2024, this year’s Soulframe presentation gives fans a live look at the team’s progress, highlighting all of the improvements, big and small.Extensive customization options are one element Digital Extremes plans to carry from Warframe to Soulframe, with the team doubling down on that idea during TennoCon today. Additionally, while Soulframe Preludes, a private early access build that is open for all this weekend, has largely seen players focus on up-close, methodical combat with swords and shields, the team has been experimenting with other options, including sidearms.

Today we're an international team, spread across the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Here are the folks who make PC Gamer happen today.Tim Clark — Brand Director US — With over two decades covering videogames, Tim has been there from the beginning. In his case, that meant playing Elite in 'co-op' on a BBC Micro (one player uses the movement keys, the other shoots) until his parents finally caved and bought an Amstrad CPC 6128. These days, when not steering the good ship PC Gamer, Tim spends his time complaining that all Priest mains in Hearthstone are degenerates and raiding in Destiny 2.

His most-played FPSes are Hunt: Showdown, Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, Team Fortress Classic, Rainbow Six Siege, and Arma 2. His first multiplayer FPS was Quake 2, played on serial LAN in his uncle's basement, the ideal conditions for instilling a lifelong fondness for fragging.Follow Evan on Twitter: @elahtiPhil Savage — Global Editor-in-ChiefUK — Phil has been writing for PC Gamer for nearly a decade, starting out as a freelance writer covering everything from free games to MMOs.

I didn’t bother with any other Nintendo games that got boosted for the new console, either. You see, rumors had been floating around that perhaps we’d finally get a glimpse at Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 indie Metroidvania where you explore a dilapidated kingdom of insects. Whispers of this sort happened every so often, as long-suffering fans of the franchise know. But this time felt different.Sure enough, a couple of days later, hope was renewed during the Xbox Game Showcase as Microsoft displayed a few seconds of Silksong gameplay footage to promote their hunker of a portable, the ROG Xbox Ally. The game, which is slated to release sometime in 2025, will bless all major platforms and be available from day one on Xbox Game Pass. That’s all well and good, except I never finished the original Hollow Knight to begin with.I’ve tried. I’ve bought the melancholy exploration game multiple times. There’s at least one save file with over a dozen hours out there, lost amid multiple generations of upgrades, data transfers, and redownloads. But while I was immediately captivated when I first tried the game out in 2017, the reality was that I couldn’t a handle a game like that just yet.By 2017, we’d gotten three major Dark Souls games and a variety of other brutal “Soulslike” experiences, many of which I would try only to end up quitting. I’d played and beaten Bloodborne, but despite its immediate recognition as a classic, it’s also an objectively a more accessible entry point for the genre. The game and its life-stealing mechanics reward aggressive play in a way that most Soulslikes of the time didn’t. A Sou",

PicturesMatt Patches is an executive editor at Polygon. He has over 15 years of experience reporting on movies and TV, and reviewing pop culture.Superman is back in a big way: Filmmaker and studio head James Gunn is taking his franchise reboot (and the blockbuster kickoff to his DCU movie initiative) into its second box-office weekend with a $261 million worldwide gross, with plenty of summer left to go. A semi-sequel is already in the works; after a cameo introduction at the end of Superman, Milly Alcock (House of the Dragon) as Supergirl will hit theaters in 2026. But here’s the big question: Where’s our great Superman video game? Gunn’s hope for the DCU is for the storytelling to be so cohesive that DC-related projects at sister operation Warner Bros. Games will click right in. “One of our jobs is to come in and make sure the DCU is connected, in film, television, gaming, and animation,” Gunn said in 2023. “That the characters are consistent, played by the same actors, and it works within one story.” The scale of such a task made at least one Marvel game developer gulp, and major upheaval over the last two years has made WB Games’ future hazy. (A Wonder Woman game, in development for years, was outright canceled in February.) If Gunn can really connect the cinematic-universe dots, his take on the Man of Steel could address the longstanding problems of, well, Superman games being absolute shite. As we detailed in a 2024 report on the legacy of DC’s Superman titles, from the notorious Superman 64 to the faulty tie-in Superman Returns, none of the previous failures could be boiled down to a single issue. Some were technological: How do you nail flying in a sandbox game where the sky shouldn’t be the limit? Others were baked into the lore: Superman has a lot of p",

It’s leapt into the Game of the Year race, something Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World likely won’t be able to. Simply put: Bananza sounds like a dope platformer, and I wanna play. But I can’t yet.If you were able to successfully fight the FOMO and make peace with waiting to purchase a Nintendo Switch 2, Donkey Kong Bananza might bring that FOMO back in full force (raises hand). Thankfully for OG Switch owners, the original Switch is home to the Bananza team’s previous game, and it’s one of the console’s best.Super Mario Odyssey launched in 2017 to rave reviews, and, as of this writing, sits as OpenCritic’s highest-rated game of all time. Interestingly, it didn’t win The Game Awards’ GOTY honor, as that honor went to fellow 2017 Switch hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (perhaps you’ve heard of it?).I was late acquiring a Switch, and picked up an OLED model in 2022. Prescient timing by me, as I got COVID a few weeks later and was able to spend my isolation playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond. I should have gotten Super Mario Odyssey too, instead of waiting until just this month to play it, as Mario’s standout 3D adventure more than lives up to the hype.Image: NintendoIn Odyssey, Bowser has once again captured Princess Peach (shocker).

While figuring out what’s up with your memories (hell yeah), you spend your time fighting giant monsters (hell yeah!) inflicted by a mysterious feathery illness (hell yeah!!!), and have to– Ah, dammit, it’s another Soulslike? Seriously?To be clear, I haven’t played Wuchang Fallen Feathers yet, but the genre it’s ostensibly part of is emblematic of a gaming trend that’s gone on for far too long: There are too many Soulslikes! Largely inspired by FromSoftware’s Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls, these action-adventure games tend to put a heavy focus on blocking, parrying, and dodging attacks, and love to throw a challenging boss fight in your path. Often, they are moody in tone. More often, they make me moody.Image: Spiders / NaconThe genre has been around in some capacity for about a decade, but I first noticed it reached a saturation point in 2022, following the release of SteelRising. Developed by Spiders, the French studio known for Greedfall, SteelRising casts you as an automaton in an alternate history timeline of Revolution-era France where you have to carve through an army of 18th-century robots protecting King Louis XVI. That’s, like, a five-exclamation point “hell yeah,” minimum. Then I played it, and despite the fascinating setup, found a game much like many I’d played before. Parry this. Dodge that. Get ass kicked by boss a few times.The following year, Lies of P caught my attention. A Pinocchio game! With steampunk vibes! Also: automatons! Then I played Lies of P, and found it muc",

Up until now, the game has been invite-only, and keys are a hot commodity. This is the first time that anyone who has simply signed up will be able to access the game — but only for the duration of TennoCon weekend. Sign-ups will close at midnight EDT on July 20.“Everyone that wants a chance to try and test our game and play it will finally be able to, 100% for sure,” said Soulframe senior community manager Sarah Asselin at a press preview in early July. “I mean, unless anything breaks. 99% for sure.”Soulframe is a massively multiplayer fantasy RPG, and the spiritual successor to Warframe. It’s set in a lush, pastoral world with some concerning rot at its heart, as players saw in an extended gameplay preview from the TennoCon main stage.The live demo showed a quest called the Fable of Bromius, the mildly devastating story of a magical bear who becomes corrupted by dark powers. The roughly 30-minute gameplay chunk showcased a ranged/caster build for the player character, the Envoy. They were able to fling magic from their staff and switch ably to bow or short knife during combat. They also had some interesting additional magical powers, like the ability to transform into a cloud of butterflies for stealth, or create what looked like a big-headed exploding decoy Envoy.I won’t spoil the end of the demo,",

She co-directed the upcoming documentary The Great Game: The Making of Spycraft.Finally, there will be a Warframe for every letter of the alphabet — and the last to arrive is a devil-themed character named Uriel. The new playable character will be part of a side story that will be released alongside Warframe’s year-end update, The Old Peace.The new Frame was revealed at TennoCon, Digital Extremes’ annual Warframe fan event. He’s a hulking figure with flame-like highlights, as if his black armor were cracking to reveal hellfire beneath. Also, he’s got a long, pointy tail, and I’m sure everyone is going to be normal about it.Digital Extremes also revealed two new Protoframes that will appear with Uriel: Harrow and Wisp.Protoframes are, without getting too into spoilery lore stuff, more or less human versions of existing Warframes. They first appeared in the 1999 expansion in December 2024. Harrow’s Protoframe is Father Lyon Allard, and Wisp’s is Marie Leroux. They’re the first Protoframes to be introduced since the 1999 update – and boy, are they Catholic.Harrow is a priestlike Warframe who terrorizes the player in an early-game quest. He carries an incense burner called a thurible, and one of his abilities is to self-flagellate with it to increase his reload and fire rate. Father Lyon Allard form is equally goth, with midriff-baring leathery armor.Wisp, meanwhile, is an ethereal, floating enchantress. Unlike Harrow, this Warframe doesn’t have overt religious imagery. The design is based on the folklore of will-o’-wisps, fae lights that lure unwitting walkers to their death in bogs and swamps. But Marie Leroux is a beautiful nun-like figure with bright yellow eyes, who is definitely going to cause problems fo",

She co-directed the upcoming documentary The Great Game: The Making of Spycraft.Warframe is coming to a dining room table near you.Developer Digital Extremes is collaborating with Pathfinder creator Paizo Games on a new TTRPG module for Warframe, using Paizo’s Starfinder system. They’ve created a standalone tabletop adventure that will launch in October 2025, and it’s called Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias.“This is just from mutual love and respect and camaraderie,” said Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford during a preview event. “We had a conversation with them, and next thing you know we were making a Warframe official TTRPG module.”Operation Orias was announced at TennoCon 2025, Digital Extremes’ annual fan convention for all things Warframe. Starfinder is an adaptation of Paizo Games’ popular Pathfinder system. Whereas Pathfinder is geared towards telling fantasy stories, Starfinder is meant for sci-fi adventures. It’s known as a rules-heavy system — making it a seemingly good fit for a Warframe adaptation, given how many interlocking systems, skill trees, and abilities make up that game. Players can take Operation Orias for a test run at Gen Con this August. Paizo will be showing a limited excerpt at its booth. Gen Con will be held in Indianapolis from July 31 to Aug. 3, 2025.See More: GamingTabletop GamesWarframeMore in this streamSee allWarframe’s next chapter will explore a new star systemBy Simone de RochefortCommentsComment Icon BubbleTennoCon 2025: Warframe is going full CatholicBy Simone de RochefortCommentsComment Icon BubbleEveryone can play Soulframe, the fantasy Warframe, right nowBy Simone de RochefortCommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularFigure out your K",

Too Kyo Games’ tactical RPG has 100 endings and I’ve only seen a handful, the game’s “true” route not among them. But, my god, I gotta get more of my feelings about this game out of my system. I know we’re all talking about big games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II as early Game of the Year contenders, but if you’re a fan of tactics RPGs and branching narratives, and you can tolerate a bit of cringe, The Hundred Line is a game too ambitious to let pass you by.

    "content": "I would rather not liken Master Detective Archives: Rain Code to the games its creative team is best known for, but I can’t help it when Spike Chunsoft and Too Kyo Games’ latest murder mystery sure does invite the comparison. Like Danganronpa before it, Rain Code is a murder mystery from the mind of Kazutaka Kodaka, adorned in the distinct art style of Rui Komatsuzaki, all to the backdrop of Masafumi Takada’s techno jazz score. Nearly every mechanic has a near 1:1 equivalent to Danganronpa, to the point where I play through and wonder if everyone involved would rather be making another one of those titles but can’t because of Danganronpa V3’s damning meta-commentary about running a series into the ground until it’s beyond recognition. Whatever the motivation, Rain Code still has a lot of Danganronpa’s pink blood running through its veins, and while it takes some time to start living up to its predecessor, it had me wrapped around its finger by its final cases and hopeful that Kodaka may have found a new outlet to indulge his fascination with mysteries without returning to a story that’s long finished. Rain Code follows a detective-in-training Yuma Kokohead in a world where detectives are superpowered figures respected around the world. He’s an amnesiac who’s made a deal with a death god named Shinigami who takes the form of a purple puffball ghost with a love of carnage and death, all while basking in it with lighthearted whimsy. Much like Kodaka’s previous work, the game uses the two characters’ contrasting views of the world to constantly oscillate between dire stakes and absurdist humor but uses its supernatural framing to crank the team’s usual antics up to an inevitable over-the-top conclusion. Much of Rain Code feels like Kodaka’s writing style at his most unhinged, no longer bound by the limitations of a (relatively) grounded setting and free to use magic, superpowers, and god-like entities to justify some wild imagery, for better or worse. For the first few ",

But in 2019 the publisher called Steam’s model “unrealistic” and chose not to launch The Division 2 on Valve’s service. Since then most Ubisoft games have skipped Steam, but in recent years, Ubisoft has started to publish its games on the platform. And in July 2024, just six months after its launch, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora arrived on Steam. This seemed to signal that the Assassin’s Creed publisher was starting to move away from its previous strategy. And now, it’s official: Ubisoft games will launch on Steam once more.

It's wonderful stuff.\r\n\nDeveloper: Balloon Studios\nPublisher: Whitethorn Games\nRelease: April 9th 2024\nOn: Windows\nFrom: Steam, Game Pass\nPrice: £21/€25/$25\nReviewed on: Intel Core i5-11340F, 16GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 3060, Windows 11\n\nBotany Manor is a game that seems calculated to make me sit up on alert like a meerkat, or crash through a wall yelling like that sentient jug mascot (I am not from America, I just know he exists). It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\n\nThe game is divided into several chapters corresponding to a research book that Arabella is filling out, with a view to submitting it for publication. I say Arabella is almost wholly untroubled as you can, if you pay attention, discover letters or articles that tell the story of how Arabella's expertise was passed over in favour of, or even entirely stolen by, less talented men over the years, because botany is a science and Victorian women should get married and do embroidery. It's a story that suggests a full but frustrating life, but it does make the conclusion sweeter if you're following along.\n\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/Whitethorn Games\n\nYour main concern, as is Arabella's, is the pl",

In fact, they never left! Go-gettin', arrow-shootin' warrior Aloy managed to delay the end of the world in Horizon Zero Dawn, but the death train is still chugging along to all life on Earth station via a (currently resonant) eco-disaster. In Horizon Forbidden West it's because the AI created to heal the planet from the prior extinction event caused by humans isn't working properly. Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It'll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.\n\nNot just them. A sequel demands new robots. The regular Watcher machines, the basic alarm/guard robots from Zero Dawn, have largely been replaced by Burrowers, akin to giant weasels. Other additions include the hippo-like Widemaws, something called a Tideripper, which is basically an electrified Loch Ness Monster, and my personal least favourite, the Clamberjaw, a motorised baboon that throws flames instead of its own shit. The design of the machines remains delightful and basically nonsensical, and as before you'll have a much better time if you hang back to observe the situation from stealth cover. Analysis ",

    "content": "Geneforge 2 - Infestation review\r\nThis Black Isle-style literary RPG puts player agency above aesthetics, with engrossing results.\r\n\nDeveloper: Spiderweb Software\nPublisher: Spiderweb Software\nRelease: March 27th, 2024\nOn: Windows, Mac \nFrom: Steam\nPrice: £17/€17/$17\nReviewed on: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 16GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060, Windows 10\n\nLike the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/Spiderweb Software\n\nAs a result, Geneforge 2 feels a bit cheap to begin with. In the moments where atmospheric bird squawks and howling winds give way, there can be little to sustain the illusion of a living world. But the gaps are soon filled by Vogel’s sharp prose and exquisite worldbuilding. The Geneforge universe - first conceived in the noughties, and fleshed out in Spiderweb’s current run of remakes - is one of the few truly original settings in the canon of western RPGs.\nIts world of swords and sorcery is d",

    "content": "Morning all! The working week once again looms above us like a bulldozer driven by raucous and somehow loveable sheepdogs in top hats and cufflinks. Quickly now, lob a few new PC game releases under the caterpillar treads to slow its passage. It's not clear where those sheepdogs are going, but your and my wellbeing are clearly of secondary importance.\nMonday 14th July\n\nToday is all about factory games, apparently. My highlights among the mass producers are Kaizen: A Factory Story, a craftsmanlike automation puzzler from former Zachtronics devs, and MoteMancer, in which you build fantastical factories in different dimensions that overlap in real-time. Note: the MoteMancer devs have said that genAI was used to \"ideate\" the art, though the final art assets were created by regular humans - or \"skinloads\" as we are known in the trade.\nIf you despise factories, please take your resentments to the tiles of Arashi Gaiden, a turn-based ninja slicer. Where is my ninja factory sim, games industry.\r\n\nTuesday 15th July\n\nToday is all about comebacks of one kind or another. Dungeons & Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition is Aspyr Media's revamping of one of the D&D RPGs people venerated before \"D&D RPG\" became synonymous with \"Baldur's Gate 3\".\nStronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition is Firefly's remastering of 2002's answer to Angry Birds.\nTroubled Bungie FPS Destiny 2 has a new edition and DLC rollout - Year Of Prophecy. The first of the new DLC packs is The Edge Of Fate, which includes a new planet featuring lost humans and forgotten Fallen houses.\nBecoming Saint is today's token Actual New Game. It's a pleasantly cracked real-time tactics roguelite in which you try to get yourself canonised before you are martyred.\r\n\nWednesday 16th July\n\nToday, it is time to exsanguinate Pikmin and daub gory geometry in occult squad tactics puzzler Worship, which should remind you instantly of Cult Of The Lamb.\n\nThursday 17th July\n\nThe Necromancer's Tale (pictured) is an open world R",

    "content": "What are the key weaknesses of all the bosses in Elden Ring: Nightreign? To survive an Expedition in Nightreign and defeat the Nightlord at the end of your run, it takes the kind of grit and stubbornness that, well, any From Software fan probably has in buckets already. But it's by no means an easy task, and certain Nightreign bosses are likely to give you heaps of trouble unless you counter them with the right types of damage.\nEvery boss in Nightreign has its own unique set of weaknesses, resistances, and immunities to specific types of damage. You may already know about the likes of Fire, Lightning, Magic, and Holy damage - but are you aware that Slashing damage is better on certain bosses than Piercing, and vice versa? Or that some bosses are entirely immune to Poison, Bleed, or Frostbite - but that Scarlet Rot immunity is extremely rare?\nIn this guide, we'll give you a full rundown of all the boss weaknesses in Nightreign - not just for the 8 Nightlords, but for all the end-of-day bosses too. Armed with this knowledge, you can prepare for every fight by hitting the right locations on the map, and exploit the exact weaknesses of each boss to maximise your success chance with each Expedition.\nIn this guide:\n\nAll Nightlord weaknesses\nAll Nightreign boss weaknesses\nBoss weaknesses explained\n\n\n\n\nElden Ring Nightreign - Which Class Should You Play?\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nAll Nightlord weaknesses\nThe 8 Nightlords in Nightreign are the strongest bosses in the game. These bosses are the end goal of each Expedition, and even in a group they're extremely tough to take down. So it's very important to take advantage of each Nightlord's greatest weaknesses.\nHere's the full Nightreign weakness chart for all 8 Nightlords:\n\n\n\nBoss\nBest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius\n\n+0%\n+0%\n+0%\n+10%\n+0%\n-50%\n+0%\n+35%\n252\n541\n541\n252\n154\n-\n\n\nAdel\n\n+0%\n+0%\n+0%\n+0%\n+0%\n-20%\n-50%\n+0%\n541\n154\n154\n154\n154\n-\n\n\nGnoster (Moth)\n\n+15%\n+25%\n+15%\n+25%\n-50%\n+40%\n-10%\n-10%\n154\n541\n541\n154\n154\n-\n\n\nGnoster (Scorpion)\n\n-1",

With so many of these bosses being optional and tucked away in the Lands Between, it can be difficult to find them all. A nightmare for any completionist, and that's before you even begin factoring in the additional bosses FromSoftware have added with the release of the Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC!\nLuckily, we have you covered with a comprehensive list of all boss locations, and a boss order recommendation to help you as you navigate through the rich lands of Elden Ring. Below you'll find maps covering every region, highlighting the exact location of every one of the Elden Ring bosses. We've also leveraged our 1000+ hours of Elden Ring experience to write a little bit on each boss encounter, to help you find and strategise against each of these adversaries.\nSpoilers follow!\nNote: If you're looking for all the DLC bosses, head to our guide on all 83 Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree boss locations! And if you're after the list of all the Elden Ring: Nightreign bosses, we've got a separate guide for that too!\nIn this guide:\n\nElden Ring boss locations maps\nElden Ring boss order\nLimgrave\nWeeping Peninsula\nLiurnia of the Lakes\nAltus Plateau\nCaelid Wilds\nMt.

Here's this big free-to-play MMO that's been growing for over a decade, adding layers upon layers of complex sci-fi lore and context to its imposing metal form.\nI couldn't tell you before googling it why one of my fellow article writers had declared in the chat for a recent press preview that Excalibur Prime users won't be spared when the revolution comes. I can tell you that its end of year 2025 update is called The Old Peace, and looks like it'll be a hoot.\n\nThe Old Peace, which developers Digital Extremes have just shown off a demo of at this year's edition of annual Warframe get-together TennCon, is all about \"the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors\" upon the Perita moon\". The demo of it kicked off with the player fighting a huge robo-lad that turned out to be manned by a small robo-lady, who then accompanies you through events you're hallucinating via a Matrix-esque tech bath with The Lotus, the mysterious figure who talks you through missions from the start of the game.\n\"You had the new war, you know about the old war,\" Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said of the update, \"but now it's time to learn about the old peace, where, as with all wars, there was a moment in time when there was an effort for peace, a treaty. There was a time on Tau when things could have been different.\"\n\n\n\nTennoCon 2025 | The Old Peace | Official Trailer\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nThe Old Peace, which'll expand Warframe's focus skill tree and add in a new baddie faction, is bringing with it a standalone side story called The Devil's Triad that looks like it'll see you take on three scary bosses to earn a new warframe and a couple of new protoframes. The frame's dubbed Uriel, it's devil themed, and it's also the last warframe that the game's former art director Michael 'Mynki' Brennan worked on prior to his death from cancer in October last year.\nBefore all of that, the game'",

This lovely crop - which looks like a pink tree with blue leaves and lovely candy floss fruits growing from the branches - originally appeared during a 2025 Easter Event, where it sold for astronomical amounts of money and could similarly yield fantastic harvest rewards.\nUnfortunately, Candy Blossom is no longer for sale after the conclusion of the Easter Event, and there's much misinformation swirling around regarding how to get this elusive crop - not to mention scammers aplenty who promise free Candy Blossom Seeds. As of July 2025's Prehistoric update, there's also a valuable new crop available in Grow A Garden - the Bone Blossom! But is it actually superior?\nRead on, for we'll give you all the details on how to get both Candy Blossom and Bone Blossom in Grow A Garden. We'll also explain whether Bone Blossom is better than Candy Blossom.\nIn this guide:\n\nHow to get Candy Blossom in Grow A Garden\nHow to get Bone Blossom in Grow A Garden\nIs Bone Blossom better than Candy Blossom?\nWill Candy Blossom come back?\n\n\n\n\nGrow a Garden: Best Wars to Get Moonlight Fruit and Earn Lunar Points\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nHow to get Candy Blossom in Grow A Garden\nThe short (and disappointing) answer is simple: you can no longer obtain Candy Blossom in Grow A Garden via traditional methods. It was solely a limited crop available during the 2025 Easter Event, and you cannot purchase Candy Blossom Seeds via the normal Seed Shop. If you missed out on the event, you're out of luck.\nFor your reference, the following bullet points show how much Candy Blossom cost in the 2025 Easter Event, as well as the great yield that this multi-harvest crop offered once you sold its fruit:\n\nSheckle cost: 10,000,000 Sheckles\nHarvest price: 90,000 ~ 100,000 Sheckles\nRarity: Divine\n\n\n\nHere's what",

They should also act as stimulating and insightful criticism in themselves. We aim to hold video games to a high standard, encouraging and challenging the medium to be the best it can be.\r\n\n\r\nEurogamer selects games for review on the basis of what we feel will interest you - whether that's in terms of the game's quality, content or profile.\r\n\n\r\nWe select reviewers based on their experience with a series, game, genre or platform, but always aim to balance specialist knowledge against a wider understanding of games, game design, and culture as a whole.\r\n\n\r\nReviews are discussed with an editor or editors before publication, but remain the professional judgement of the reviewer. Star ratings (see below) are set by the reviewer, based on their own review's text; editors may propose changes to them but these are only ever made with the reviewer's agreement.\r\n\n\r\nWe expect our writers to spend enough time with a game to understand it intimately, but this is not an exact science and the requirements of different games vary greatly. We trust and expect our reviewers to make informed judgements about what is appropriate. This situation is also influenced by the availability of review materials; we may delay a review if we are not satisfied with the time available.\r\n\n\r\nWhat we review, and when\r\n\n\r\nWe only review games from retail copies, or versions that are identical to a retail copy of the game.

    "summary": "A look at Final Fantasy 16's muddled approach to accessibility.",
    "content": "The road to Final Fantasy 16 has begun. After presentations, previews, and a general sense of breathlessness surrounding Square Enix's latest iteration of the Final Fantasy series, an interesting titbit has emerged. Final Fantasy 16 will include a level of accessibility in the form of equipable rings that alter the fundamental gameplay experience.\r\n\n\r\nSquare Enix has revealed five of these rings that we're expected to fit into three slots: one that slows incoming attacks, another which removes the need to give commands to an ancillary character, another that ties combos to a single button, and one each for automating dodges - because every game must have dodge rolls now, apparently - and healing.\r\n\n\r\nIf these sound like typical accessibility features, that's because they are. Square Enix's intentions behind this system aren't immediately clear. As reported by Game Informer, Naoki Yoshida, the game's producer, suggests the rings about making \"something that felt accessible but also customizable so that each player could create something that felt like a difficulty level that matched them,\" going on to suggest Square Enix had \"listened to players that are maybe not as good at doing combos and attacking.\" (This is spoken through a translator.) \"Some players maybe are not as good at dodging as other players.\" This is the target audience for the rings then, as opposed to being considerations specifically for disabled players.\r\n\n\n\n\nFinal Fantasy 16 Combat Breakdown + New Gameplay!

From the world of 2017's Breath of the Wild, Nintendo has created something richer and more malleable through a grander story, an expanded map, and the ability to build countless contraptions to torture innocent Koroks. Fifty hours in, I'm yet to even start any story-related adventure, and I'm more interested in dressing Link in cute outfits. Does that make the game good or bad? I have no idea!\r\n\n\r\nAs with so many Nintendo games, however, it's an evolution that comes with a price to pay for many players. Tears of the Kingdom may be a glow-up for Switch-era Hyrule, but fundamentally little has changed in the six years between titles. Which is to say that the game remains, somehow, both accessible and inaccessible at the same time.\r\n\n\r\nThis is only made more clear by the accessibility advancements the gaming industry has made between The Legend of Zelda releases. These are advancements that may have finally cracked the perceived apathy towards accessibility exhibited by Japanese studios, but that Nintendo continues to ignore.\r\n\n\r\nIt's disappointing, if not exactly unexpected, to see players struggle with the biggest game of 2023. And one that, if Elden Ring's enduring popularity is anything to go by, will be part of online conversation for years.\r\n\n\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Official Trailer #3\n\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer.Watch on YouTube\n\r\nThat Tears of the Kingdom wouldn't prioritise accessibility in its development has been evident as early as 2019, when Jason Schreier asked series director, Eiji Aonuma, about the lack of button mapping in Breath of the Wild.\r\n\n\r\n\"If we freely let players do customizations on key assignments and such, I feel like we're letting go of our responsibility as a developer,\" Aonuma said. \"We have something in mind for everybody when we play the game, so that's what we hope players experience and enjoy as well.\"\r\n\n\r\nPressed on the import",

It was the only Star Wars game in the history of time and space that I was unable to finish, and the existence of accessibility barriers constantly made me contemplate turning to the Dark Side.\r\n\n\r\nThe darkest era for the Jedi Order is the perfect foundation for Respawn to explore the evolution of the Jedi, to acknowledge the unhealthy traditions that needed to be forgotten and define the type of Jedi that Cal wants to be.

From now on, we will no longer be scoring games out of ten.\nIn place of scores, we'll have one-line summaries for every review, and a new recommendation system whereby some, but not all games will be considered Recommended, Essential or Avoid. As a result of these changes, we will no longer be listed on the review-aggregation site Metacritic.\nWe are also changing (or firming up) other areas of our reviews policy, with the intention of ensuring that we always review the same experience that you get when you buy a game. This means that we will only review from final retail versions and online games will be reviewed after they've launched.\nSo, why are we doing this? How does it work? What does it mean? Read on to find out. (There'll be an opportunity to ask me more about this change in a live question and answer session here on Eurogamer later today.)\n\n\n\nGames are changing - so reviews should too\nSince Eurogamer launched 15 years ago, the way video games are made and distributed has changed almost beyond recognition. In the last few years in particular, the rise of digital distribution and the assumption that most consoles and all computers are connected to the internet has resulted in much more fluid game development. Some games evolve right up to the moment of their commercial release, with a day one update. Some games are released commercially long before they are finished, via 'early access' versions. Some games never stop evolving.\nThe vast increase in popularity of online gaming has also changed our expectations, changed the designs of many types of game, introduced new technical challenges and increased the interaction between games and their audiences. You can argue that games with strong social multiplayer elements don't meaningfully exist - and can't be properly tested or understood - until they're being p",

    "content": "Hey again, Tom here. I'm really excited to announce today that Eurogamer reviews are changing. Here's a bit about how, and the thinking behind why.\r\n\n\r\nIn short, Eurogamer is moving to a five-star review rating system, beginning this week.  \r\n\n\r\nFor years now, I've felt our existing review badges weren't working hard enough for us, or for you. We ended up recommending a lot of games, or not giving a badge at all to many others - which meant readers not acquainted with our odd four-point scale had nothing to go on. We rarely used Avoid, because it always felt a bit mean. \r\n\n\r\nIt's been eight years since Eurogamer ditched the 10-point review scale and we're not going back to that - the argument then that it felt broken through overuse of its upper half still stands. At the same time, I strongly believe we need to convey how we feel about games in a more straightforward manner. \r\n\n\r\nWhich brings us to five stars. It's universally understood, simple to take in at a glance, and easily shared. \r\n\n\r\nIn my blog post a couple of weeks ago, I wrote that I was keen for Eurogamer to look back to its roots where appropriate, as a home for video game coverage that feels fearless and helps drive the conversation. It's a conversation I'm keen for our reviews to stand out in, to match the brilliant writing you've come to expect from our team. There's more about all of that below from reviews editor Chris Tapsell, including detail of a new accessibility options listing I'm also delighted to be adding.\r\n\n\r\nFor now, I can't wait for you to see Eurogamer's first starred review with our verdict on Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Join us then.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nNewscast: Is Zelda playable in Tears of the Kingdom?\n\n\n\nNewscast: Is Zelda playable in Tears of the Kingdom?Watch on YouTube\nChris Tapsell writes...\nHello!

    "content": "League of Legends mega-studio Riot Games takes the big leap into TV with confidence and panache - but Act 1 can be just a touch predictable.\nEditor's note: just a heads up that we do get into some light story details here, although much of it is known if you're already familiar the characters already from the games.\nAs with everything Riot Games produces these days, the money is very much on the screen in Arcane, its striking new animated series that's first act arrived on Netflix this past weekend, the second arriving on the 13th. As a fan of League of Legends (to my eternal shame), it is an unsurprising treat, full of winks and nods and shiny blue nuggets of lore, just as I'd hoped, and indeed suspected, a studio of Riot's now formidable stature could manage. As a fan of just plain, good television though, it very much is a surprise. Arcane is actual, good TV.\n\nArcane - Act 1 review\n\nProduced by: Riot Games, Fortiche\nReleased via: Netflix\nAvailability: Act 1 out now on Netflix, Act 2 on 13th November, Act 3 on 20th November.\n\n\nTo get the obvious question out of the way: no, you very much do not need to be a LoL fan to enjoy Arcane. It's a prequel, and the goal here is pretty obvious - to hook in a new wave of fans through an entirely new medium, who may even stick just to that medium. Arcane is set a few years before the \"now\" of League of Legends, whenever that really is. Basically, it follows a handful of characters from LoL, but they're all a few years younger. Those that regular players might know as being in their 20s are instead in their teens and tweens, those in their late 30s are in their early 20s, those in their mid-300s, like the Yoda-esque Yordle scientist, Heimerdinger, are in their early to mid-ish 300s.\n\n\n\nArcane: Official Trailer\n\n\n\nArcane's polished trailer.Watch on YouTube\nIt's a clever way to balance the two - an avalanche of freshly backfilled lore for the LoL nerds, and an equal entry point for new viewers who know nothing - and Riot has been",

    "content": "Nintendo excises its last Hollywood effort with a safe blockbuster return for its most dependable of mascots. \n\r\nIt's taken 30 years, but Nintendo finally has a Super Mario Bros. movie to please the masses. As a life-long Nintendo fan, I still can't quite believe it exists - even seeing photos of Shigeru Miyamoto rubbing shoulders with Chris Pratt on the Hollywood red carpet this week felt like a bizarre collision of galaxies - and yet in this age of Sonic the Hedgehog film sequels and Mushroom Kingdom theme parks, it's simultaneously odd it has taken this long. Here we are then, with 90 minutes of bright and breezy fare bringing Mario and the gang to the big screen in an adventure which is all-action and wafer-thin on plot - just like most Mario games! - albeit with a few tantalising hints at character development buried between the constant cameos and continual laughs.\r\n\n\r\nAside from those cameos, it's almost impossible to spoil the Super Mario Bros. Movie's story, such that it is. Mario is the everyman from New York, a do-good plumber with an extended pasta-eating Italian family and little brother Luigi who he's always looked out for. The film spends longer than expected setting up Mario's Brooklyn background (accompanied by a couple of nice voice cameos from original Mario voice actor Charles Martinet), though never dares sit still for too long. Amidst several plumbing and platforming action sequences, the movie finds time to smartly acknowledge Mario's new Chris Pratt accent (which quickly settles on the ear) and hand-wave the practicalities of a plumber in pristine white gloves. Quickly, however, both brothers end up magically sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom, leaving them separated and placed on two very different paths.\r\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.

When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: \"That's great!\"\n\n\n\nTO A T | Reveal Trailer\n\n\n\nTO A T | Reveal Trailer.Watch on YouTube\nReminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked \"ah, these are the words of a professional\", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, Automaton).\n\"While I don’t know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed,\" Ueda said. \"I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.\n\"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. \"Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition.\"\nUeda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.\nInterestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. \"Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I’ve had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here,\" Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try.\n\"As a result, I've never played a",

    "content": "Way before mechanical keyboard makers started packing layers of sound dampening foam into their boards, Japanese firms Topre and PFU were building expensive, whisper-quiet keyboards using a unique electro-capacitive switch for a cloud-like typing feel. \nThese models stood out against the growing sea of Cherry MX derived mechanicals, and attained a legendary status in the enthusiast community - particularly the expensive Topre Realforce, which was notably described by computer mag Micro Mart as the \"Aston Martin of keyboards\". It's a keyboard that I've longed to own for years, but outside of flying to Japan or getting lucky on Ebay, it just wasn't going to happen. \nOne day in December 2022, knee deep in a dissertation on German history, I just thought I'd have a look - and to my surprise, a Topre Realforce R2 PFU Limited Edition had come up for sale from a seller who seemed to specialise in old Fujitsu kit. I snapped at the chance, picking it up without really taking note of how much I'd spent, like it was the Infinity Gauntlet or the Ark of the Covenant. The box arrived in tatters, but the keyboard inside? Pristine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: the black-on-grey legends are hard to read, but give the keyboard an interesting look. Right: the key in the upper right hand corner allows you to change the actuation setting for the keyboard, making it more or less sensitive.  | Image credit: Digital Foundry\n\nSo what makes the electro-capacitive switches inside the Realforce so treasured? In basic terms, under each key is a conical spring that sits inside a rubber dome, with a sensor beneath the spring that can tell when it's been compressed as it forms an electrical circuit. Combine the soft feel of a rubber dome and the tactile snap of the spring, and you have a keyboard that feels entirely different to both old-school rubber dome keyboards and modern mechanicals. \nThis particular \"PFU Limited Edition\" model is also superbly quiet, with 45g silenced switches, which makes it ideal for no",
